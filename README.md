# **Online Shopping Behavior Analysis by Age**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze the impact of age on online shopping behavior using a dataset of consumer purchases. By exploring patterns such as product preferences, shopping frequency, and spending habits across different age groups, we hope to uncover insights that can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies.

### **Objectives**
- Analyze spending behavior across age groups.
- Identify the most popular product categories by age.
- Predict the likelihood of discount usage based on age and spending habits.
- Segment customers into meaningful clusters based on their shopping behavior.

---

## **Dataset**
- The dataset used for this analysis is the **Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset** from Kaggle. The data includes customer demographics (age, gender, etc.), purchase history, product preferences, and more.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - `Age`: Customer's age
  - `Purchase_Amount`: Amount spent during the transaction
  - `Category`: Product category purchased
  - `Discount_Applied`: Whether a discount was used (Yes/No)
  - `Payment_Method`: Mode of payment (Credit card, PayPal, etc.)

## **Features and Data Mining Tasks**
1. **Clustering**: Group customers into segments based on their age and spending patterns.
2. **Classification**: Predict whether a customer is likely to use a discount based on their age, product category, and spending amount.
3. **Regression**: Predict spending amounts based on customer age and product categories.
